```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

<p align="center">
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
</p>

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## My python solution

```{python}
x = list([1, 2])
xeven = list([2])
x2add = 2

while x2add <= 4 * 10**6:
    x2add = sum(x[(len(x) - 2):])
    x = x + list([x2add])
    if x2add % 2 == 0:
        xeven = xeven + list([x2add])

print(sum(xeven))
```
